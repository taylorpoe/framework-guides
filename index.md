title: Famous Framework (alpha)
---

The Famous Framework is a new JavaScript framework for creating reusable, composable, and interchangeable UI widgets and applications. It balances _declarative_ with _imperative_ and _functional_ with _stateful_, and it's built on top of the [Famous Engine](https://github.com/Famous/engine). We are excited to make it available as open source under an MIT license for the first time as part of a public alpha.

## Should I use Engine or Framework?

It depends on your needs.  The Framework is aimed at building larger applications or reusable components that are easily mixed and matched inside other applications or frameworks.

The Engine is a better choice for small projects or “bespoke” work where deep integration isn't a priority, for example a highly interactive art piece.  At this point in time, the Engine is also more mature than the Framework.

Engine and Framework are the two halves of the Famous Open Source Project.
