## Welcome to the [Famous Framework](Famous.org/framework) prose guides repo! 

**For the Famous Engine prose guides check out the repo here: [github.com/Famous/engine-guides](https://github.com/Famous/engine-guides)**

We've exposed this content so that you can help us provide more accurate and refined learning resources. This repo contains all of the raw Markdown content for the [famous.org/framework](https://famous.org/framework) section of the website. Note that Tutorials are broken into thier own folders and the prose guides/API docs are located in the root directory of this repo.

_While this repo does not expose any of the website's markup, feel free to file issues here about broken links or inconsistencies with the famous.org website in general._ 

## Style tips intro

In addition to typos and grammatical errors, we encourage the community to let us know if any section is unclear or needs an update, but please leave detailed comments when filling issues about content. 

The following guidelines should be followed for new code and existing code that needs cleanup. Note that these are only guidelines and there may be some exceptions to the rules.

## Titles

All prose should be saved as Markdown (.md). Files should begin with the following heading where the file's `title` is listed in title case. 

    ---
    layout: default
    title: The Tile
    ---

Note that there is only one title per page. The convention above should be used in place of a title created through a single pound ( `#` ) notation.

## Subheadings

In your md files, use two pound signs with a single space for subheadings. Only the first letter is caplitalized (sentence case).

     ## Your heading

Note that while there can be multiple subheadings in a document, there should not be any single pound ( `#` ) headings/subheadings in a document.

## Comments accompanying code

Use two slashes for comments: `//`. Comments should be formated in sentence case with a single space between the start of the comment and the text. Comments should not end with punctuation unless followed by another sentence:
    
    // This is a comment that will be broken into
    // two separate sentences. Note the single  
    // period in between

## Code 

When including inline code (within text) we use  two backticks around the &#96;code&#96;. For block sections of code or any code example, use four spaces.
    
    // This is four spaces out
    
Any method name, variable, property, HTML tag within text should be highlighted as code using two backticks ( ` ).


## Method names

Always include a period and parenthesis when referencing a method name i.e. `.methodName()`. 


## General style tips

 - Avoid whitespace at the end of line or on blank lines.
 - Lines should be no longer than 80 characters, and must not exceed 100 (counting tabs as 4 spaces). There are 2 exceptions, both allowing the line to exceed 100 characters: If the line contains a comment with a long URL. If the line contains a regex literal. This prevents having to use the regex constructor which requires otherwise unnecessary string escaping.
 - `if`/`else`/`for`/`while`/`try` always have braces and always go on multiple lines.
 - Unary special-character operators (e.g., !, ++) must not have space next to their operand.
 - Any , and ; must not have preceding space.
 - Any ; used as a statement terminator must be at the end of the line.
 - Any : after a property name in an object definition must not have preceding space.
 - The ? and : in a ternary conditional must have space on both sides.
 - No filler spaces in empty constructs (e.g., {}, [], fn())
 - Two spaces should be used for code examples. 

## Guidelines for building tutorials:

While we try to limit the pronouns `'we'` and `'you'` in the prose guides, the tutorials can be more informal. All of the guidelines above still apply for tutorials as well as some additional markup and formatting tips listed below.

## Intro sections  

Use the `intro-graf` class for the first main _intro_ section to your page like so: `<span class="intro-graf"></span>`. 

In these sections, try to answer: What you're doing and Why you're doing it?

## Images

Add images to the [./assets/images](#) folder and include them using this format: 

`![image desc](./assets/images/yourimagename.png)`

## Links to repo 

For modified files/links back to the repo we use the `sidenote--other` class with the following format:
    
    <div class="sidenote--other">
    <p><strong>Modified files:</strong> <a href="##">ModifiedFile.js</a></p>
    </div>

## Section repos

Section recaps (link to the repo at that step) use the `sidenote` class with this format:

    <div class="sidenote">
    <p><strong>Section recap:</strong> <a href="##">Code for this step</a></p>
    </div>


## Up next buttons

We use the following format:

    <span class="cta">
    [Up next: Your next section name &raquo;](./Yournextsectionname.html) 
    </span>
